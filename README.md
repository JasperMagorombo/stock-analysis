# Energy Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The goal of this project was to analyze the market activity of 12 energy companies from 2017 to 2018. VBA was used to expidite the data modeling process.

## Analysis

### 2017 Insight
2017 was a great year for energy companies, 11 out the 12 companies studied had positive returns with 4 returning at least 100%. Interestingly DQ had the least trading volume, yet the highest returns, showing that at the time it was likely being viewed as a high growth potential company.

The refactored code showed incomparable performance efficiency.

### 2018 Insight
2018 was a rough year for the energy sector, only 2 of the 12 companies studied managed to end the year with positive returns. Gains were consolidated to two high volume tickers ENPH and HASI while the rest of the market bled out. DQ was hit hardest by the sector correction losing roughly 63% of its valuation from the start of the year.

## Summery
It is clear that the refactoring of our code in VBA led massive performance bonuses, which is probably the best reason to refactor code. In order to successfully refactor though a thorough road map is needed as you will need to know where you can trim the fat of your code. The tradeoff in refactoring is the time spent optimizing code vs. the efficency gain of the code.
